steps to prepare this directory for importer work:

copy the following unpacked client data directories here:

* bin/
* object_library/

Next, copy texture_library/  ( this will cause conversion of all textures into their basic form )

next copy a file to be converted into prefabs into it's proper geobin path

The easiest to test would be copying `unpacked_client_data_folder/geobin/object_library/Omni/Omni.bin` to `geobin/object_library/Omni/Omni.bin` 

Remember to watch the Unity console for some Log-spam :smile:
